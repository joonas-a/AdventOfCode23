### My Rust submissions for Advent of Code 2023

- Each day's problem is in it's own cargo project, both parts in the same binary `main.rs`

- Input (from [AoC website](https://adventofcode.com/2023/)) should be put to a file named `data.txt` in the given day's `src` folder

- Then, the algorithm can be run with `cargo r -r`
